## 🧠 Project Summary

**AgroGPT** is a GenAI-powered PWA designed to assist small and mid-scale Indian farmers with hyper-local, actionable agricultural advice. Unlike traditional agri-chatbots, AgroGPT evolves by learning directly from real farmer inputs and environmental data.

### 🔍 Key Features:
- Multilingual voice, text, and image input
- GPT-4 powered query answering with fallback mechanism
- Peer-to-peer farmer advice routing via Firebase
- GPT-validated, community-trained learning loop
- IoT-based soil sensing (moisture, pH, temperature via ESP32)
- Semantic filtering of responses using Weaviate
- Text and voice-based output using Google TTS
- Gamified reward system for peer contributors
- Offline-ready and lightweight PWA for rural usage
